## Oculus library for Processing

Work in progress, requires Processing 0244 (beta6) or higher. You are welcome to
contribute!

It uses JOGL's [stereo utilities](http://jogamp.org/deployment/jogamp-next/javadoc/jogl/javadoc/com/jogamp/opengl/util/stereo/package-summary.html), as they are available in JOGL 2.3.2. 

Based on this [example](https://github.com/sgothel/jogl/blob/master/src/test/com/jogamp/opengl/test/junit/jogl/stereo/StereoDemo01.java).
