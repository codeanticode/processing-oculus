## Oculus library for Processing

Work in progress, requires Processing 0244 (which will be available as beta6 soon) or higher. More updates soon. Of course, you are welcome to contribute!

It uses JOGL's [stereo utilities](http://jogamp.org/deployment/jogamp-next/javadoc/jogl/javadoc/com/jogamp/opengl/util/stereo/package-summary.html), as they will be available in JOGL 2.3.2 (particularly the sensors API).

Based on this [example](https://github.com/sgothel/jogl/blob/master/src/test/com/jogamp/opengl/test/junit/jogl/stereo/StereoDemo01.java).
